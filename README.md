# CS-370
### CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project I was given several classes and the backbone for the maze game. The code that I created myself was the code to implement the Q-training algorithm for the artificial intelligence agent. I implemented code to initialize the deep Q network, to conduct the observational and model-guided episodes, monitor progress, to interface with the other classes to achieve action/reward functionality including backpropagation, and to adjust the epsilon values to balance exploration and exploitation during training.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
The learning gained in this class has been extremely relevant to the current trands in computer science as a whole. While Chat-GPT is the current flavor of progressive Ai application, the general field of artificial intelligence is gaining massive momentum and causing everyone, even those not in the computer science space to consider the impact these tools may have for better or worse on the world. This class gave a solid footing for the basics of machine learning, notable advancements, the current state of compliance and ethical considerations with regard to Ai, and invited conjecture about bold new applications of these techniques. 

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists study the theories, uses, and implications of software and computer systems. It's a broad field that covers everything from the abstract to practical and ethical implications of applying computer systems. The reason that this matters is that increasingly computer systems are interacting with and driving the world around us. Everything from smart devices to cars and greater infrastructural systems are modelled by, created with, updated, and monitored with computer systems. Along with these increasingly complex applications of these systems, the impact of the choices made during the development and deployment of these systems is having further reaching consequences. This is especially true in the field of artificial intelligence, where systems make decisions which impact our lives.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems as a computer scientist with an eager mind, exploring the realm of the problem and possible solutions in an attempt to bring the greatest positive impact to the end user. I do my best to ensure visibility and openness with the organizations I collaborate with, and to make decisions which are ethical and relevant. 

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organizations I work with are to ensure the utmost security and relevance in the solutions that I generate. It is up to me to ensure a high level of accountability and transparency when leveraging computer systems to solve user needs, that edge cases are accounted for, and that solutions align with the greatest good for the greatest amount of people in society.
